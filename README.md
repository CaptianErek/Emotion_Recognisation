# Emotion_Recognisation

## Facial Emotion Recognition - Data Preprocessing and Augmentation

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that prepares a **Facial Emotion Recognition** dataset for machine learning workflows. It handles downloading, cleaning, augmenting, normalizing, and converting the dataset into a TensorFlow-ready format.

---

## Overview

The notebook performs:

- üì• Downloading the dataset from Kaggle
- üßπ Cleaning unnecessary files
- üõ†Ô∏è Augmenting images (rotation, brightness, contrast, flipping)
- üìè Normalizing images based on ImageNet mean and std
- ‚ö° Creating batched and prefetched TensorFlow datasets

---

## Features

- Download and automatically extract dataset
- Advanced data augmentation for better model generalization
- Image normalization for efficient training
- TensorFlow-ready dataset creation
- Easy to extend and modify
